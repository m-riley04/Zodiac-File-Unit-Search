## Updates

_30 January 2025_: I have recieved an email from NARA with the official digital scans of the Zodiac file unit. They are [hosted on OneHub](https://ws.onehub.com/files/un4p95yb). I have downloaded the entire file unit PDF and uploaded it as-is to the repository. This came MUCH faster than I expected it to (since they gave the 90-120 day delivery estimate).

## Special Thanks
Endless thanks goes to u/bubbacow2 for volunteering to make the trek. They saved me (and others) a 90-120 day waiting period for these files. See their [post from 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/151a6cs/why_people_with_clearances_dont_post_to_reddit/).

## Why?
I love history and learning, and I'm intrigued by witness testimony. Why not?

## Documents and Organization
The repo is structured to be easy to navigate and clearly separates the different file units from each other. Each directory has it's own README for clarity on it's purpose. There are also OCR (text-searchable) PDFs in each of the file unit subdirectories.

> NOTE: None of the images are renamed. They are the original image files with the exception of a few redactions in `verification`.

## National Archives Expedition
This "expedition" by u/bubbacow2 took place on 1/17/2025 at approximately 10:00AM EST. The purpose was to scan/photograph the documents from [NAID 40514714](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/40514714) as to evade the 90-120 day delivery estimate given to me by NARA.

### Results
The entire process went off without a hitch. They were not able to get "scans", but their color photographs are very high quality and all text is very readable.
